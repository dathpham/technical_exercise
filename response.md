1. Understanding data quality is essential in data science, and data quality encompasses a variety of dimensions. Examine the Occurrence table and evaluate the completeness of the dataset. Use these findings to provide recommendations about what types of analysis could be conducted with this data to better understand aviation accidents and safety incidents as reported in the ASIS data.

4. Develop a model that predicts the probability of surviving a safety incident. What are the key factors
associated with survivability? What are the strengths and weaknesses of your analysis and what would
your next steps be with this model?
